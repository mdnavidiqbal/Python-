## For Loop Problem and solution : 

# # Problem-1: Print first 10 numbers using a for loop :
# for num in range(10):
#     print(num )

# # Problem-2: Print sum of all even numbers from 2 to 22 : 
# sum = 0 
# for num in range(2,22,2):
#     sum = sum + num 
# print(sum)

# # Problem-3: Calculate the square of each number of list: 
# numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
# for num in numbers:
#     print(num,"Square is: ",num**2)

# #Problem-3: Calculate the average of the list number : 
# number = [10,20,30,40,50]
# sum = 0
# for num in number:
#     sum = sum + num 
# number_len = len(number)
# average = sum / number_len
# print(average)

# # Problem-4: Print all even and odd numbers 0 to 20 : 
# for num in range(0,20):
#     if num % 2 == 0 : 
#         print("Evenr number is : ",num)
#     else: 
#         print("Odd number is : ",num)

# # Problem-5: Brek the loop if number a number is grater than 15 : 
# numbers = [1,4,7,8,15,20,35,45,55]
# for num in numbers:
#     if num > 15:
#         break
#     else:
#      print(num)

# # # Problem-7: Reversed the list usig for loop :  
# number = [10,20,30,40,50]
# for num in reversed(number):
#     print(num) 

# # Problem-8: Reversed the fixe number : 
# num = 5
# for num in range(num,-1,-1):
#  print(num)
